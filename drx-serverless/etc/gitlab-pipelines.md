# GitLab Pipelines

The Git Repository - and the pipelines used to build and deploy the code - are stored in GitLabs.

- [https://gitlab.cochlear.dev/](https://gitlab.cochlear.dev/)

The code specifically for this project is stored here (and presumably you have access or you wouldn't be able to 
read this!).

- [https://gitlab.cochlear.dev/drx/drx-serverless](https://gitlab.cochlear.dev/drx/drx-serverless)

The pipeline for this repo is configured using the following file:

- `drx-serverless/.gitlab-ci.yml`

And the output of the deployment can be reviewed here:
